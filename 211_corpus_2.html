 <h1> Animal Shelter </h1><p>The Houston SPCA operates a high-quality, high-capacity shelter. We provide services to over 50,000 animals each year, primarily dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, small mammals, horses and farm animals. At our shelter, we typically receive owner-relinquished pets, injured strays and animals rescued from cruel and inhumane conditions. Occasionally, due to cruelty investigations rescues, we also house large and/or exotic animals, such as tigers, bears and chimpanzees. These animals are safely housed in a secure location at the shelter while we work to secure permanent placement at quality, AZA-accredited sanctuaries. The Houston SPCA shelter offers an open and welcoming environment to encourage potential adopters to get to know the many wonderful dogs, cats, birds and small mammals we have available. Horses and farm animals live on-site and at a satellite ranch facility. In an effort to provide care across a range of needs, our kennels come in varying sizes, to accommodate animals humanely, ensuring that they have enough space to walk, play and lie down without feeling cramped or overcrowded. Littermates and animals surrendered from the same home may be placed together for the animals’ comfort, but we never place more animals than can be accommodated into a single kennel. Animals are given enrichment toys, treats and beds, and all cats’ kennels have perches to climb on. Daily, all animals in the shelter receive care and socialization by our staff and volunteers, and dogs are taken on multiple walks. The Houston SPCA does not euthanize healthy, animals due to age, time limits or space. Once an animal is entered into the adoption program, he/she will only be euthanized if he/she develops a serious health or behavior issue. All animals are spayed or neutered prior to placement - https://www.211texas.org/zf/profile/service/id/1239459</p>
